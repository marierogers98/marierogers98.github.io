*Hello, Website!*
My name is Marie Rogers and I am a junior psychology major at Appalachian State University!  Some of my interests include snowboarding, hiking, and cooking.  I am currently working towards getting research experience for grad school.  I hope to study neuropsychology in my graduate studies.
